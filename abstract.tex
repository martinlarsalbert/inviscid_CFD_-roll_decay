\section*{ABSTRACT}\label{abstract}
Getting the best possible accuracy with the lowest possible
computational cost is an important factor in the early design stage of
ships. Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for
seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is
however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll
damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a
hybrid method, as a solution to this problem, where the viscous roll
damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing
3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) method. The hybrid
method is investigated using roll decay tests with the KVLCC2 test case.
This investigation shows that the accuracy of simulated roll motions is
significantly improved and also shows good agreement with the
corresponding roll decay model tests.
