Many cost efficient methods have been developed over the years to analyze various aspects of ship hydrodynamics such as: resistance, propulsion and seakeeping. Getting the best possible accuracy to the lowest possible cost, is an important factor in the early design stage of ships. Using potential flow has partly presented such a solution for seakeeping, with good accuracy for heave and pitch, but not for roll, where the roll damping contains both inviscid and viscous effects. Roll motion is however often a critical degree of freedom (DOF) that needs to be analyzed since large roll motions can result in cargo shifting or even capsizing. 
%Roll motion is also very hard to predict, being the result of nonlinear restoring forces and nonlinear damping. The roll damping can be assessed with high accuracy by means of experimental model tests or RANS calculations. This is however not very efficient solutions when considering time and cost constraints, especially when being multiplied, during design iterations. Taking the shortcut of potential flow to improve efficiency with acceptable accuracy works for other DOFs such as heave or pitch, but not for roll because of large viscous effects. Many semi empirical formulas to add the viscous damping was therefore developed during the 1970s, where Ikeda's method is the most pronounced. 
The viscous part of roll damping can be assessed with high accuracy by means of experimental model tests or URANS calculations, but these are generally too expensive solutions in the early design stage of ships. Many semi empirical formulas to determine viscous damping were therefore developed during the 1970s, where Ikeda's method is the most pronounced.

The viscous damping from this method is normally combined with invicid roll damping from strip theory. With today's computational power, more advanced potential flow methods can however be used in the seakeeping analysis to get better accuracy, but still at low costs. 
This paper investigates if 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) solved by means of a Bounday Element Method (BEM) can be used togther with the viscus contributions from Ikeda's method.

% 3 method/methodology that has been used
The new approach of replacing the strip theory with FNPF is investigated by conducting roll decay simulations. Comparisons are made with both the classic strip theory approach and roll decay model tests, to see that this is an improved approach to insert roll damping in the seakeeping analysis.
