\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

A hybrid method to predict ship roll motions has been proposed. The
method combines an existing Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow Method (FNPF)
with the viscous damping contributions from Ikeda's method. Simulations
of roll decay test were in very good agreement with corresponding scale
model tests. The method can be used to get more realistic roll motions
in seakeeping simulations using potential flow calculations. This is
important when roll motions is of primary interest, but can also
influence other motions through coupling effects or the fact that the
radiated waves from the roll motions are otherwise exaggerated. The
separation of viscous and invicid roll damping in Ikeda's method seem to
give very good results together with the FNPF method for the KVLCC2 test
case.

A potential error in Ikeda's method was found in the eddy damping
prediction, which was revealed by comparison with Ikeda's original
experiments. The implementation of the method did not reproduce the
original results. Instead a new regression, using a decision tree model,
was used to replace this part of the method. This reproduced the results
from Ikeda's experiments and gave much better results with the hybrid
method for KVLCC2 roll decay simulations in the present study.
