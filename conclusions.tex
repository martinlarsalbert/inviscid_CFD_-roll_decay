\section*{CONCLUSIONS}\label{conclusions}
A hybrid method to predict ship roll motions has been proposed. The
method combines an existing Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow Method (FNPF)
with the viscous damping contributions from Ikeda's method. Simulations
of roll decay test were in very good agreement with corresponding scale
model tests. The method can be used to get more accurate roll motions in
potential flow simulations. This is important when roll motions are of
primary interest, but can also influence other motions through coupling
effects or the fact that the radiated waves from the roll motions are
otherwise exaggerated. The separation of viscous and invicid roll
damping in Ikeda's method seem to give very good results together with
the FNPF method for the KVLCC2 test case.
\quad A new regression formula to calculate the sectional eddy damping
was also proposed in this paper. The regression formula reproduced the
results from Ikeda's experiments and gave much better results with the
hybrid method for KVLCC2 roll decay simulations in the present study.
