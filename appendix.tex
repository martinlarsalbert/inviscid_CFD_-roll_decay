    \subsection*{Lewis sections}\label{lewis-sections}

    The Lewis section coefficients were calculated as:

    \subsection*{KVLCC2}\label{kvlcc2}

 The section table for KVLCC2 is shown in
Tab.\ref{tab:kvlcc2_section_table}, where the lewis section
coefficients have been calculated using the equations above.
